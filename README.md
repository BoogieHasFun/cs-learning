# cs-learning

### what it's for
for me it was for learning more about c# and my first no video tutorial project.

### what it is
it's a calculator that allows you to change between the 4 main operations, doesn't include varibles or anything speical, it's just basic math.

### how can i get it?
build it your self by downloading the project, then running ``dotnet build`` (i think) or opening the project up in vs code and pressing ``F5`` on your keyboard to run it

if you can't build it yourself or just don't want to, then either click on the Actions tab or download it from the releases.

### reminder: windows 64 bit only
